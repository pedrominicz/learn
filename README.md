This repo contains various experiments made while learning Lean. Thus far I believe the [Natural Number Game][1] is the best entry point for someone with some familiarity with Type Theory.

Coming into Lean I had read [Programming Language Foundations in Agda][2] and the first volume of [Software Foundations][3]. This time, however, I want to take a more "top-down" approach and try to formalize some mathematics without caring too much with the nitty-gritty Type Theory details.
